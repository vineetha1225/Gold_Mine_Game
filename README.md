# Gold Mine Game
A simple yet intelligent AI-based game simulation where an agent navigates through a gold mine grid to collect the maximum gold using backtracking algorithm. Built entirely in Python (IDLE environment), this project features step-by-step animation to visualize the path taken by the AI.

## Objective: ##
To implement a decision-making AI that finds the optimal path to collect the maximum amount of gold in a mine grid, considering allowed moves and constraints.

## AI Logic & Approach: ##
* Uses recursive backtracking to explore all valid paths from the top row to the bottom.
* At each cell, the agent can move:
  * Right
  * Right-Up (diagonal)
  * Right-Down (diagonal)
* Tracks maximum gold collected and path taken.
* Animation simulates agent’s journey across the grid.

## Key Features:
* Grid-based gold mine (2D matrix input)
* Backtracking-based AI logic
* Real-time animation of the agent’s movement across the grid.
* Highlights the optimal path and displays maximum gold collected.
* Designed to run in Python IDLE for simplicity.

## Technologies Used:
*Language: Python
* Logic: Backtracking, recursion
* UI/Animation: Tkinter 
* Platform: Python IDLE

## Learning Outcomes:
* Understanding of backtracking algorithms and their application in game AI.
* Use of Python for algorithm visualization.
* Hands-on experience with state space search and path optimization.
